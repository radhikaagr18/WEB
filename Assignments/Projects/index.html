    <a class="toggle" href=#>Web-Enabled Illumination Survey and Mapping System </a>
    <p class="inner">
      Web-Enabled Illumination Survey and Mapping System | Innovation Lab | IIT Kharagpur <br>
• Built a handheld device for illumination surveying of geo-fence; engineered a lux-meter, caliberated it to minimize error <br>
• Organised the data captured and mapped it showing the intensity at each surveyed points, creating a GUI for potential users.
